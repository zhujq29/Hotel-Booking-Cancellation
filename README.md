# Hotel Booking Cancellation
This is the group project for STATS506 at Umich.

We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data from Kaggle to get insights from seasonal trends of hotel industry, and built machine learning models to predict hotel cancellation. We evaluated performances of multiple classification methods, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression,
and k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and the highest accuracy was 80.8%. Besides, embedded feature selection method, lasso regression with 10-fold cross validation was used to improve accuracy.

The project was done with R and Jupyter Notebook.
